# React_Agenda

## About

This a web agenda built on React.JS. On this app you are able to add events and remove them as well. When clinking either on the right arrow or the left arrow it will go to 
either previous month (when clicking on left arrow) or next month (when clicking on the right arrow). 

## Add an event

When you click on one of the days that you want to create an event the `Add event` button will be enabled, right after you click on the `Add event` button and modal will pop up 
and it will ask you for the name of your event and the description about it. Also, you can close the modal by clicking outside of it. 

## Removing an event

If you decide to remove an event, you just have to click on right bottom on the event that you want to delete, right after the `Remove event` button will be enabled in order to
cick on it. Once you click on the `Remove event` button and modal will pop up asking you if you are sure that you want to delete that event. Once you confirm it the event will
be removed from the events container.
